<h1>Big Man On Campus: Week 1, Day 2</h1>
<p>If a barn-door back is on your list of school supplies, you've come to the right place. Steve Cook will take you to mass class.<br></p>
<p1>You're probably sore from yesterday, but it's not time to rest. Not yet. To become the Big Man, you need to focus and prepare for another hour against the iron.<br>

  Your classes, homework, friends and girlfriend can wait. This hour is yours. It's time to hit the gym; it's time to blast your back and biceps.<br>
