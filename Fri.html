<h1>Big Man On Campus: Week 1, Day 5</h1>
<p>Today's lesson is all about building big traps and shoulder caps. Steve Cook will teach you the best way to get big.<br></p>
<p1>Listen up, Big Man: In your busy schedule of classes, work and chasing girls, you need to make time to train your shoulders. No physique is complete without big shoulders and defined traps.<br>

Sure, you trained yesterday, but your shoulders don't care if your legs are sore. That's why we're going to hit your delts heavy and hard. Let's grow.<br>
